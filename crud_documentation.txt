# CRUD Operations on MongoDB - Sales Data

## 1.Create (Insert New Records)
- Two new sales records were manually inserted into MongoDB.
- Example Record:
  {"date": "2/2/2025", "product ID": 51, "sales amount": 120, "store location": 3}
- This allows adding future sales data dynamically.

## 2.Read (Query Data from MongoDB)
- Queried sales based on store location, product ID, and date.
- Example Queries:
  - Find all sales from store location 3.
  - Find all sales for product ID 51.
  - Find all sales on "1/1/2013".
- This enables analysis of sales trends and key performance metrics.

## 3. Update (Modify Records)
- Sales amount for Product ID 51 on "2/2/2025" was updated from 120 to 500.
- Example Query:
  sales_collection.update_one(
      {"date": "2/2/2025", "product ID": 51},
      {"$set": {"sales amount": 500}}
  )

- Updating records ensures accuracy and up-to-date financial reporting.

## 4.Delete (Remove Outdated Records)
- All sales records before "1/1/2015" were deleted to maintain database efficiency.
- Example Query:
  sales_collection.delete_many({"date": {"$lt": "1/1/2015"}})

- Removing old records optimizes storage and speeds up queries.

## Why CRUD Operations Are Important
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations ensure efficient database management:
- **Create** → Adds new sales data dynamically.
- **Read** → Retrieves key sales insights (best-selling stores, products).
- **Update** → Corrects incorrect data and updates transactions.
- **Delete** → Removes outdated or unnecessary data.

## Finally
- **Sales data is stored in MongoDB** and dynamically updated.
- **Dash visualization displays real-time sales data** after CRUD operations.
- **The project successfully integrates a NoSQL database with interactive dashboards.**
